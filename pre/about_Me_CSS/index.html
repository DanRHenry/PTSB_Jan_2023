<!-- 
In the About Me Page project, you will create a single HTML page in CodePen that contains information about who you are. 

It should have the following qualities:

An image of you of your choice.
Links to websites you enjoy.
Your name, age, and location.
Several hobbies that you enjoy.
What you hope to achieve with Upright.
To achieve this criteria, you will need to use almost all of the information given in the pre-work. As this is the HTML project, you do not need to incorporate layout, styles, or any visual design. You will revisit this project at the end of the CSS pre-work and apply those concepts then.

This project should be completed as a new pen in your CodePen account. Refer to the video in the Sign-Up for CodePen process if you have forgotten how to create a new pen. 

All three pre-work projects will be collected at the end of the pre-work program. Be sure to know where to find your projects for the submission form that will come later.
